# Platinum Mobile DJ Song Requests App
This project showcases my knowledge of HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, and RESTAPIs. I built it for a Djing company. It's purpose is to enable people to go to this app and request a song for the DJ to play. the DJ is then able to review it as it is submitted to a special playlist on Spotify. They can then decide to play it or not.
